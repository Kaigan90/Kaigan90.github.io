## Project description
This project compares the implementation of balancing a binary search tree.  The two methods compared are AVL and Splay.  The comparisons are for the actions of inserting, deleting, searching and searching the same element.  The outcome of the comparison can be seen through the plot graphs. 

## How to compiles / run the program

Program runs in command line.  In order to gather performance data the funciton to be analyzed needs to be inputed on line 12 of main.cpp.  Given makefile with source code the run routine is as follows:
```bash
make
./main > data.txt
```
After data files have been collected for each function desired run performance plot.

## UI Design

Command line program, no UI design.

## 3. Additional Considerations
Performance may vary depending on hardware.
